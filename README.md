# web-scraper--text-image

This is a python tool developed to scrape any web element (text or image) from any websites. The tool has been tested on 20 websites and works perfectly fine. Initially, the tool took longer to scrape the details, but now it has been optmized to make it more efficient in terms of time and changes. The tool requires 'chromedriver.exe' as an engine to initiate the Chrome browser to perform scrapping. I'm sharing just one input and output file (Amazon website) as an example. 

I'm also sharing 'Scheduler.bat' file if there is need to automate the web scraping process by scheduling this file with the operating system.

For more details on how the process works, please feel free to connect or raise questions. Will be happy to help!
